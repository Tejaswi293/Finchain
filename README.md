This event brings together innovators from across the globe to develop cutting-edge solutions to pressing challenges in the financial sector. We are excited to present our approach to tackling the problem statements under the themes of "Blockchain" and "Tezos and Etherlink".

## About Hack7Days 2024

The Hack 7 Days Tezos India x GTBIT Hackathon is a week-long challenge aimed at providing practical exposure to college students in India who are interested in blockchain development. The hackathon is being held in collaboration with various Tezos Clubs set up in different colleges and universities across India.

The key themes are:
- We can build a decentralized application (DApp) on the Tezos or Etherlink blockchain platform. The DApp can be related to any field such as finance, gaming, or 
  social media, among others. 
- We can also incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and explore their various use cases.

## Our Commitment
Our team is dedicated to addressing these critical issues with innovative, technology-driven solutions. We are leveraging advanced blockchain and cutting-edge technologies to build robust systems.


## Our Approach

Our approach is rooted in understanding the nuances of each problem statement and developing comprehensive, user-friendly solutions. We believe that technology can bridge gaps and create a safer, more inclusive financial ecosystem.
